The water cycle is a continuous process by which water circulates between the earth's oceans, atmosphere, and land. Water evaporates from oceans, lakes, and rivers into the air, forms clouds, and returns to the earth as precipitation. This process ensures that water is replenished for plants, animals, and humans.
